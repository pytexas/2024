# About the PyTexas Conference

## What is PyTexas?

PyTexas is the annual, regional gathering for the Python community in Texas. PyTexas is organized and run by community
volunteers. PyTexas, like most of the Python community, is focused on providing a [diverse](#diversity-statement)
and enjoyable experience for everyone interested in Python. Please help us do that by following
the [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct).

#### Volunteers

PyTexas is organized and run by volunteers from the Python community. We generally assign tasks beginning the Thursday
night before the conference and going through the conclusion of the conference on Sunday. If you would like to help,
please send an e-mail to [volunteers@pytexas.org](mailto:volunteers@pytexas.org). We'll contact you as conference time
approaches.

#### Contact Us

Please feel free to email [conference@pytexas.org](mailto:conference@pytexas.org) with any questions.

You may also reach the larger Texas Python community by joining the mailing list, which is used for general community
discussions. Python-oriented job postings are also welcome on the list.

#### About This Site

This site acts as the primary public facing website to the PyTexas Conference. It is built using Python and Mkdocs
Material.

## Code of Conduct

PyTexas is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
participants in any form.

### Abridged Version

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyTexas.

## Diversity Statement

Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful conference environment that invites participation from people of all
races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientation. PyTexas and its organizers support and
endorse the Python Software Foundation's [diversity statement](http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/):

*"The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Our
community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to
these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome
you."*

We're actively seeking to increase the diversity of our attendees, speakers, and sponsors through our calls for
proposals, other open submission processes, and through dialogue with the larger communities we serve.

Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse conference experience:

- Recommend appropriate speakers and/or program committee members to the conference organizers
- Forward our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups with the message that we are looking for a diverse speaker
  roster
- Suggest to potential speakers that they submit a proposal during our Call for Proposals conference phase
- Organize community-based public speaking trainings and practice events (Ignite is one popular format)
- Suggest ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and supportive, free from intimidation and
  marginalization (send an email to PyTexas organizers)
- Share your ideas and best practices for how we can realize our vision (send an email
  to [PyTexas organizers](mailto:conference@pytexas.org))
- We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your contributions to bringing balanced
  representation of the richness of our collective human experience. Help us do this by following
  our [code of conduct](/about/code-of-conduct).
