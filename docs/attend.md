## 2024 Health and Safety Guidelines

Our attendees' health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor 
the state of the pandemic and look to venue, local, state, and CDC guidelines to
make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.

### Masking and Vaccinations Recommended
The PyTexas team encourages everyone in attendance to be up to date with their
COVID-19 vaccinations. The team also recommends facial coverings when indoors and 
unable to social distance.

**Harassing anyone for their decision regarding masking will be considered
a violation of our [Physical Spaces Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pytexas/code-of-conduct/blob/main/physical-spaces-code-of-conduct.md) and will result in 
appropriate action.**

### Rapid Testing

We encourage attendees to do a rapid test before traveling and consider testing
during the event, especially if you will be eating indoors with people. We did look
into providing free, rapid onsite testing for participants, but it is not feasible 
(logistically or financially) for an event like ours.

### Attendance
Individuals should not attend the event if they are COVID-positive, are exhibiting COVID symptoms (as defined by the CDC), or have been exposed, within 7 days prior to the event, to someone who was COVID-positive or showed COVID symptoms.

If you are feeling sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for
COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on any day of the conference, 
please contact us at [conference@pytexas.org](mailto:conference@pytexas.org), and we will exchange your ticket type for 
an online ticket or grant you a refund.

### Travel
Anyone traveling to the event should read and abide by the CDC's Travel Guidelines 
for domestic and international travel. We ask that participants respect fellow 
attendees and do everything possible to ensure an environment that is as safe as 
possible.

### Monitoring of the Requirements Will Continue
We've monitored COVID-related news and data since the pandemic started, and we will 
continue to do so moving forward. We continue to follow all CDC guidelines in 
addition to those of the local government and venue. International, national, 
regional, and local sources are closely watched and will result in a change of 
policy if warranted.

**The guidelines implemented for PyTexas 2024 are subject to change based on health
and safety recommendations at the time of the event. We are committing, however, to
only make changes in the direction of greater protections.**


## Grants

Our goal is to ensure that everyone who wants to attend PyTexas can do so, regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity,
ability or sexual orientation. One way we make this possible is by providing financial assistance to community members
that are otherwise unable to attend.

In addition to already subsidized rates for individuals, students and those under the age of eighteen, this grant can be
used by those in need to cover registration fees, hotels, and travel. These opportunity grants come directly from the
PyTexas budget on a case-by-case basis.

Currently we have a limited budget and are evaluating what we can provide. Tickets are generally the easiest thing to
grant, and we are aiming to have some cash to help reimburse travel/lodging.

If you are facing a financial hardship, or would not be able to attend without assistance, please fill out the
application below. Applications will be approved by Feb. 20<sup>th</sup> 2024.
