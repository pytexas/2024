# Frequently Asked Questions

???+ question "What can I do if I can't afford to attend?"

    PyTexas offers a limited number of opportunity grants for community members that would be otherwise unable to
    attend: [see here for more details](about#grants).

???+ question "Can I get a discount for volunteering or speaking?"

    Accepted speakers will get a free ticket to the event. 

???+ question "How much of my sponsorship or ticket price goes to the conference?"

    The short answer is: as much as is needed. Our goal each year is to put on the best conference we can muster. In the
    event that we gather more funds from sponsorship or ticket sales than we need for the conference, we simply roll the
    remainder over to the next year. This helps us build a sustainable offering that Texas Python developers can rely on
    year after year.

    We aspire eventually to use excess funds to support outreach programs, day care for conference
    attendees who are parents, scholarships for underprivileged attendees, and other worthy expenses
    that further the goals of the PyTexas Foundation. We welcome your input on how we can best
    assist the Texas Python community!

???+ question "My organization doesn't use Python. Why should I sponsor PyTexas?"

    There are several reasons to consider sponsoring the PyTexas conference even if your
    organization doesn't currently use Python. First, you should consider using Python!
    It's a remarkably flexible language that has established libraries for and applications
    in web development, data science, science at large, and more.

    Second, the trend in modern software development is toward **polyglot programming**. That is,
    the best developers are competent in multiple languages and prefer to "pick the right tool for
    the job." Polyglot programmers can bring to the table idioms and architectures that aren't
    apparent to developers steeped in only one technology. Even if your organization primarily uses
    [Go](http://golang.org/) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), you can increase your
    recruiting reach and encourage internal innovation by hiring smart developers -- regardless
    of what language they work in today. You can even make this part of your presence at the conference!
    Feel free to submit a "X for Pythonistas" talk; we promise it will get due consideration.

???+ question "Is my contribution to PyTexas tax-deductible?"

    The PyTexas Foundation was organized as a Texas non-profit corporation in 2014 and received its
    501(c)(3) recognition in early 2015. Although we cannot guarantee that your contribution to
    PyTexas will be tax-deductible (we aren’t tax attorneys and just don’t know), you can rest
    assured that any contributions to the organization will always be used to further the common
    goals of the Texas Python community, and never for personal benefit.

???+ question "What is your refund policy?"

    In the event of cancellation, registration fees will be fully refunded. For any
    pre-order items (e.g. t-shirts), orders will be refunded if cancellation happens before
    the order is made, otherwise items will be shipped.
