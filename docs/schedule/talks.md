## 20 GOTO 10: How to Make Scrolling ASCII Art

Scroll art is a form of animated ASCII art that beginners can make. Using loops, print(), and random numbers, you'll learn how to make a surprisingly wide variety of digital art within the constraints of text strings. You'll also learn about the history of ASCII art, computer education, and where to find inspiration for your own digital art.

## Designing a Human-Friendly CLI for API-Driven Infrastructure

As Bloomberg's infrastructure grows and evolves, the tools we use to manage it are becoming increasingly important. To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and numerous other open source projects, we built a stable, extensible tool that greatly improves how we interact with our infrastructure.

## Iterate, Iterate, Iterate!

The iteration protocol and generators are Python's power tools. Properly used, they allow for clearer code that is easier to debug and understand. The talk will cover the iteration protocol itself, generator functions and expressions, the itertools and more_itertools libraries, and how to use them to up your Python level.

## Lessons learned maintaining open source Python projects

I started maintaining open source projects back in 2016 with tox. In 2018, I became a virtualenv maintainer. Today, this has now ballooned to 16 different packages where I'm the primary maintainer (+6 other projects where I help out). On average, these packages get more than 360 million downloads each month.<br><br>In this talk, I will share my experience, and explore how I manage to pull this off while also having a primary job and a family. I will present which techniques I tried, what worked, and what did not. I will also share my views on how one should approach maintaining an open source package to avoid burnout.

## Plugging in with pkgutil, importlib, inspect, and a little spit

Sometimes, you want to build a framework where expansion can come via installed python packages and modules. There are third party libraries to handle that, but maybe you don't want something that heavy weight, don't want to handle the burden of security and quality testing releases, or just want to write your own so you know how it works. I'll walk you through how to create a pluggable framework where plugins can be delivered as Python packages. I'll show you some useful standard library packages that you need, some pitfalls along the way, and how to get a working prototype in no time!

## _Python_ Code vs. _Pythonic_ Code: What Experienced Developers Find Challenging About Learning Python

Python has a reputation for being very easy to learn. Despite this, experienced developers often struggle with working as effectively with Python (e.g., writing Pythonic code) as they are with other programming languages with which they are more familiar. This talk will leverage the experiences of a professional trainer to demystify this dichotomy with the goal of understanding the motivating reasons for it, and making suggestions on how to help developers new to Python move quickly from writing _Python_ code to writing _Pythonic_ code.

## Rest Easy with Jupyrest: Deploy notebooks as web services

Jupyter notebooks are awesome! However, a notebook on its own is not a product or a service. Bridging this gap usually involves a complete rewrite into a web service that leaves behind all the awesome-ness of the notebook. What if we didn't have to do this? That's where Jupyrest comes in! Jupyrest is a library I created to solve this exact problem for my team at Microsoft. In this talk I'll show you how you can turn your Jupyter notebooks into a web service without any modifications to it. Jupyrest is being used at Microsoft by data scientists to deploy hundreds of microservices.

## Sanely working with Legacy Code

For many developers, they will inevitably have to work with legacy code at some point in their careers. It requires a different set of skills to navigate these codebases as opposed to greenfield code where you start with a clean slate. Join me in exploring techniques to approach legacy code including how to improve documentation, increase testing coverage, refactoring code into smaller more testable units and techniques when you lack time to add tests.

## Voice Computing with Python in Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook is a popular platform for writing literate programming documents that contain computer code and its output interleaved with prose that describes the code and the output. Recently, it has become possible to use one's voice to interact with Jupyter notebooks. This capability opens access to those with impaired use of their hands. Voice computing also increases the productivity of workers who are tired of typing and increases the productivity of those workers who speak faster than they can type. I split voice computing into three activities: speech-to-text, speech-to-command, and speech-to-code. Several automated speech recognition software packages operate in Jupyter notebooks and support the three activities to a certain degree. I will provide examples of all three activities as they pertain to applications of Python to our research on the molecular structures of proteins and nucleic acids important in medicine. I have developed and shared several software tools at MooersLab on GitHub and Codeberg that facilitate using existing voice computing software in Jupyter.

## Working with Audio in Python (feat. Pedalboard)

Python can do (nearly) anything, but using Python to work with audio has always been a complicated and messy affair. In this talk, we'll be going through how digital audio works, how Python can be used to play with audio data, and how a new library - Pedalboard - can help. Pedalboard is a simple, fast, and performant library for doing common audio tasks in Python, including applying effects, using VSTs and audio plugins, and encoding/decoding various audio formats.
