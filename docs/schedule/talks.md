## Sanely working with Legacy Code

_Talk_{:role=doc-subheading}

For many developers, they will inevitably have to work with legacy code at some point in their careers. It requires a different set of skills to navigate these codebases as opposed to greenfield code where you start with a clean slate. Join me in exploring techniques to approach legacy code including how to improve documentation, increase testing coverage, refactoring code into smaller more testable units and techniques when you lack time to add tests.

## Voice Computing with Python in Jupyter Notebooks

_Talk_{:role=doc-subheading}

Jupyter Notebook is a popular platform for writing literate programming documents that contain computer code and its output interleaved with prose that describes the code and the output. Recently, it has become possible to use one's voice to interact with Jupyter notebooks. This capability opens access to those with impaired use of their hands. Voice computing also increases the productivity of workers who are tired of typing and increases the productivity of those workers who speak faster than they can type. I split voice computing into three activities: speech-to-text, speech-to-command, and speech-to-code. Several automated speech recognition software packages operate in Jupyter notebooks and support the three activities to a certain degree. I will provide examples of all three activities as they pertain to applications of Python to our research on the molecular structures of proteins and nucleic acids important in medicine. I have developed and shared several software tools at MooersLab on GitHub and Codeberg that facilitate using existing voice computing software in Jupyter.

### Speaker: Blaine Mooers

## _Python_ Code vs. _Pythonic_ Code: What Experienced Developers Find Challenging About Learning Python

_Talk_{:role=doc-subheading}

Python has a reputation for being very easy to learn. Despite this, experienced developers often struggle with working as effectively with Python (e.g., writing Pythonic code) as they are with other programming languages with which they are more familiar. This talk will leverage the experiences of a professional trainer to demystify this dichotomy with the goal of understanding the motivating reasons for it, and making suggestions on how to help developers new to Python move quickly from writing _Python_ code to writing _Pythonic_ code.

### Speaker: Heather Crawford

## Lessons learned maintaining open source Python projects

_Talk_{:role=doc-subheading}

I started maintaining open source projects back in 2016 with tox. In 2018, I became a virtualenv maintainer. Today, this has now ballooned to 16 different packages where I'm the primary maintainer (+6 other projects where I help out). On average, these packages get more than 360 million downloads each month.<br><br>In this talk, I will share my experience, and explore how I manage to pull this off while also having a primary job and a family. I will present which techniques I tried, what worked, and what did not. I will also share my views on how one should approach maintaining an open source package to avoid burnout.

## Designing a Human-Friendly CLI for API-Driven Infrastructure

_Talk_{:role=doc-subheading}

As Bloomberg\u2019s infrastructure grows and evolves, the tools we use to manage it are becoming increasingly important. To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and numerous other open source projects, we built a stable, extensible tool that greatly improves how we interact with our infrastructure.

## Iterate, Iterate, Iterate!

_Talk_{:role=doc-subheading}

The iteration protocol and generators are Python's power tools. Properly used, they allow for clearer code that is easier to debug and understand.
