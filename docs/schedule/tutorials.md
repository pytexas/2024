### Python 102: Beyond the Basics

One of the benefits to Python is the ability to be productive while knowing a 
small subset of the features the language has to offer. While this is one of Python's
super powers, many Python developers are missing out on the full experience by not
diving deeper into the wonderful features Python has to offer. 

In this tutorial, you will go beyond the basics of Python and explore various language
features that make Python _pythonic_. Specifically, you will learn about:

1. Fist-class Functions
1. Decorators
1. Comprehensions
1. Dunder Methods & Operator Overloading
1. Context Managers
1. Iterators & Generators

This will be a hands on tutorial. All exercises will be distributed as a GitHub
repository and as Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab. 

**Prerequisites**

* A laptop you can program on
* A functioning web browser or your favorite IDE/Text Editor setup, ready to run
Python
* Python 3.8 or newer

### `def test_my_code_with_pytest():`

Testing is such a vital way to make sure your code works – and to uncover any 
bugs that might be there. Thankfully, testing doesn’t need to be difficult, even 
if you haven’t done much testing or automation before. With a few foundational 
principles and some Python code, you can start writing effective tests at unit, 
integration, and end-to-end levels.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to automate tests with Python’s most popular 
test framework, pytest. Specifically, we will cover:

1. Configuring a Python project with pytest
2. Writing unit tests for Python libraries
3. Writing API tests with requests
4. Writing UI tests with Playwright
5. Leveraging features like fixtures, parameters, configs, and mocking

Bring your laptops, because this will be a hands-on workshop! You don’t need to 
be an expert programmer, but you should be familiar with Python syntax like 
functions and classes.
