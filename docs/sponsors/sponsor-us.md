# Sponsors

The PyTexas Conference is an annual gathering of Pythonistas put on by the PyTexas Foundation. We’re excited to announce
that we will be returning on April 19 - 21, 2024, to the Austin Central Public Library in Austin, TX. This event is 100%
community organized and is funded through the generosity of our sponsors.

## About the PyTexas Foundation and PyTexas Conference

The PyTexas Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to educating
developers within Texas about Python.The PyTexas Conference is the foundation’s only fundraising event of the year, and is the oldest regional Python conference in 
North America, and possibly the world. The event is an annual one that has been
held every year since 2007 (with a few exceptions), making this the 18th year. 
**On average, we sell out our venue and have 200-250 attendees a year.**

## Notable Changes in our Prospectus

We have updated our prospectus for 2024 to include more benefits to sponsors and
to help us attract sponsors whom we believe our attendees will love. A few key 
things to highlight:

* Our Platinum Package (limit 2) offers a full 25-minute talk prior to lunch on the
day of your choice.
    * Talk topic is subject to organizer approval.
    * Selection of day to present will be first come, first serve.
* Every tier sponsor is given a small portion of time during various parts of
the day to talk about their company, product, or project.
* We are expanding how many sponsors we allow and are offering different sized tables for different tiers.

## How We Use The Funds

All sponsorship funds are used for the benefit of the PyTexas Conference and
Foundation and the Texas Python community. We utilize funds to pay our venue, 
endors, supplies, and all other things conference related. Any surplus funds that we
collect are used to fund the minimal operating cost of the Foundation for the
remainder of the year (primarily costs around bookkeeping, email, and foundation
governance), as well as make next year’s PyTexas better.

Also, in an attempt to make PyTexas as accessible as possible to everyone, we 
subsidize our Individual ticket prices with Corporate tickets and Sponsorship 
funds. By doing this we are able to keep PyTexas Individual tickets as low as
possible, ensuring that everyone can attend. If an attendee can’t afford a ticket,
they can apply for a grant where we can offer them free tickets and sometimes 
funds for travel expenses.

## Health and Safety

Our attendees' health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor
the state of the pandemic and look to venue, local, state, and CDC guidelines to
make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.


You can view our full [Health and Safety Requirements](attend#health) on our website.

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room

All of our organizers are Texas residents and are all too familiar with the Texas 
Legislature's continued attacks on certain marginalized communities. PyTexas is
dedicated to creating a safe and inclusive space for all attendees, and will adhere
to the guidelines laid out in our [Code of Conduct](about#code-of-conduct).
