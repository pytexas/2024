Our goal each year is to put on the best conference we can muster. In the event that we gather more funds from sponsorship or ticket sales than we need for the conference, we simply roll the remainder over to the next year. This helps us build a sustainable offering that Texas Python developers can rely on year after year.</p> <p>We aspire eventually to use excess funds to support outreach programs, day care for conference attendees who are parents, scholarships for underprivileged attendees, and other worthy expenses that further the goals of the PyTexas Foundation. We welcome your input on how we can best assist the Texas Python community!</p> My organization doesn't use Python. Why should I sponsor PyTexas? <p>There are several reasons to consider sponsoring the PyTexas conference even if your organization doesn't currently use Python. First, you should consider using Python! It's a remarkably flexible language that has established libraries for and applications in web development, data science, science at large, and more.</p> <p>Second, the trend in modern software development is toward polyglot programming. That is, the best developers are competent in multiple languages and prefer to \"pick the right tool for the job.\" Polyglot programmers can bring to the table idioms and architectures that aren't apparent to developers steeped in only one technology. Even if your organization primarily uses Go or Ruby, you can increase your recruiting reach and encourage internal innovation by hiring smart developers -- regardless of what language they work in today. You can even make this part of your presence at the conference! Feel free to submit a \"X for Pythonistas\" talk; we promise it will get due consideration.</p> Is my contribution to PyTexas tax-deductible? <p>The PyTexas Foundation was organized as a Texas non-profit corporation in 2014 and received its 501(c)(3) recognition in early 2015. Although we cannot guarantee that your contribution to PyTexas will be tax-deductible (we aren\u2019t tax attorneys and just don\u2019t know), you can rest assured that any contributions to the organization will always be used to further the common goals of the Texas Python community, and never for personal benefit.</p> What is your refund policy? <p>In the event of cancellation, registration fees will be fully refunded. For any pre-order items (e.g. t-shirts), orders will be refunded if cancellation happens before the order is made, otherwise items will be shipped.</p>"},{"location":"attend/","title":"Attend PyTexas 2024","text":""},{"location":"attend/#buy-tickets","title":"Buy Tickets","text":"<p>Purchase PyTexas 2024 Tickets</p>"},{"location":"attend/#venue","title":"Venue","text":"<p>PyTexas 2024 is being held at the Austin Central Public Library in Austin, TX:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"attend/#map","title":"Map","text":""},{"location":"attend/#hotels","title":"Hotels","text":"<ul> <li>The LINE Austin</li> <li>JW Marriott Austin</li> <li>Hyatt Place Austin Downtown</li> <li>Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Austin-Downtown/Convention Center</li> <li>Hyatt Regency Austin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"attend/#food","title":"Food","text":"<p>To name a few....</p>"},{"location":"attend/#bbq","title":"BBQ","text":"<ul> <li>Terry Black's Barbecue</li> <li>Cooper's Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que</li> <li>Stubb's Bar-B-Q</li> </ul>"},{"location":"attend/#tex-mex","title":"Tex-Mex","text":"<ul> <li>Torchy's Taco's</li> <li>Freebirds World Burrito</li> <li>Baby Acapulco</li> <li>Taco Joint</li> <li>Chuy's</li> <li>El Alma</li> <li>Taquero Mucho</li> </ul>"},{"location":"attend/#fast-food","title":"Fast Food","text":"<ul> <li>Whataburger (A Texas Classic)</li> <li>Whole Foods Market</li> <li>Starbucks</li> <li>The Picnic - Food Truck Park</li> <li>Thundercloud Subs</li> <li>P.Terry's Burger Stand</li> </ul>"},{"location":"attend/#parking","title":"Parking","text":"<p>While at PyTexas you may park in the Austin Public Library parking garage while space is available.

To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and numerous other open source projects, we built a stable, extensible tool that greatly improves how we interact with our infrastructure.</p> <p>Speaker: Oliver Rew</p> <p></p> <p>As a software engineer and a lifelong tinkerer/maker, I have a deep-rooted passion for building, fixing, and breaking things.
